# Customer_Segmentation
## Objective
I used the online retail dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository for exploratory data analysis and customer segmentation using RFM Analysis K-Means Clustering.

This notebook covers:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploartory Data Analysis
3. RFM Analysis
4. K-Means Clustering

## Insights
I ranked each customer's value to the company based on three categories, how recent was their last purchase, how often do they transact with us, and how much have the spent on our products. By ranking each of these categories we can group customers into 6 different segements that we can target with a different marketing and sales strategy. Then I implemented the predictive model, k-means clustering, using the customer data.
